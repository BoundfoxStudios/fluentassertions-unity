# Fluent Assertions for Unity

This package contains the current version of FluentAssertions 6.8.0 ready to use with Unity.

If you encouter any bugs, which are related to the package and not to FluentAssertions itself, feel free to open an issue. 

For more information about FluentAssertions itself, please head over to https://fluentassertions.com.

## Pre-requirements

* Unity 2021.2 or newer
* .NET Standard 2.0 scripting backend

## Installation

### OpenUPM

The package is available on the [openupm registry](https://openupm.com). It's recommended to install it via [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli).

```
openupm add com.boundfoxstudios.fluentassertions
```

### Unity Package Manager

Window -> Package Manager -> + sign -> Add via git url:

```
https://github.com/BoundfoxStudios/fluentassertions-unity.git#upm
```

## Setup

Then, reference FluentAssertions in your test's assembly definition and you are good to go!

## Troubleshooting

If you get the following error:

* `The type or namespace name 'DynamicMethod' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)` or
* `The type or namespace name 'ILGenerator' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)`

then you need to define the following scripting symbol (Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Other Settings -> Scripting Define Symbols): `NETSTANDARD2_0`.

Wait for Unity to recompile, the error should be gone then.

If not, please open an issue.

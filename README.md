This package contains the current version of FluentAssertions 5.9.0 ready to use with Unity.

If you encouter any bugs, which are related to the package and not to FluentAssertions itself, feel free to open an issue.

## Pre-requirements

* Unity 2018.3 or newer
* .NET Standard 2.0 scripting backend

## Installation
Simply install the package, reference FluentAssertions in your test's assembly definition and you are good to go!

## Notice for Unity < 2019
When importing the package into Unity < 2019, do not import the examples folder, since it uses the new Unity Test Framework package.
However, FluentAssertions itself is working.
